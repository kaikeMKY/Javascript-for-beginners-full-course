var myname = "nome"; // declare the string variable

myname = "0";//now myname is now 0 but could be a number or any data if i want to change

const pie =3.14; //a const is inmutable the only way to change is by changing the value on the const here


//var or variables can be a number,a string, null,
var test ="value"; //the value of a variable can be easely changed 
test = 1; //test is now a number not a string anymore
//the variables can be changed
